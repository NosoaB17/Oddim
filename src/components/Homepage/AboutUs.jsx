        To put machine learning and deep learning techniques into practice, you
        can not only design algorithms, but also there is a great need for
        infrastructure know-how, such as data preprocessing, building a
        distributed development environment, resource management, and process
        management. Based on the experience of conducting various AI projects,
        Dudaji accelerates the implementation of related data and ideas as a
